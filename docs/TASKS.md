# Tasks: Crop Yield Prediction Application

This Tasks document outlines the development process for the Crop Yield Prediction Application, structured into **Epics** (high-level groupings of related work), **Pull Requests (PRs)** (manageable feature branches or milestones), and **Commits** (granular, atomic changes within each PR). This structure ensures the project is broken down into digestible pieces for a developer or an LLM to implement sequentially, promoting clean code, version control best practices, and iterative progress.

The project uses:
- **Frontend**: React with Redux.
- **Backend**: Python Flask RESTful API.
- **Database**: MongoDB (replacing MySQL for better scalability with unstructured data like weather logs and predictions).
- **ML**: Scikit-learn (Random Forest Regressor), NumPy, Pandas.
- **Other**: Microservices architecture, with historical weather data loaded from CSV initially.

Assumptions:
- Version control via Git (e.g., GitHub).
- Each PR branches from `main`, includes tests where applicable, and merges after review.
- Total timeline: ~12 weeks, but adjustable based on velocity.
- Focus on core features first; future roadmap items (e.g., real-time weather integration) are out of scope.
