# Contributing to Crop Yield Prediction Application

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Crop Yield Prediction Application! We welcome contributions from the community to improve the project, whether it's fixing bugs, adding features, improving documentation, or suggesting enhancements. This document outlines the guidelines for contributing effectively.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
- Use the GitHub Issues tab to report bugs, suggest features, or ask questions.
- Search for existing issues before creating a new one.
- Provide a clear title, description, steps to reproduce (for bugs), and any relevant screenshots or logs.

### Submitting Changes
1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button on the top right of the repo page.
2. **Clone Your Fork**: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/crop-yield.git`
3. **Create a Branch**: Use a descriptive name, e.g., `git checkout -b feature/add-real-time-weather`.
4. **Make Changes**: Follow the project structure (e.g., `/frontend`, `/backend`). Adhere to code style:
   - Python: PEP 8 (use Black or Flake8).
   - JavaScript: ESLint with React best practices.
   - Commit messages: Use conventional commits (e.g., `feat: add new endpoint`, `fix: resolve DB connection issue`).
5. **Add Tests**: Ensure new code is tested (unit/integration for backend, Jest for frontend).
6. **Update Documentation**: If changes affect usage or API, update relevant docs in `/docs`.
7. **Commit and Push**: `git commit -m "feat: your message"` then `git push origin your-branch`.
8. **Open a Pull Request**: From your fork, create a PR to the `main` branch of the original repo.
   - Provide a clear title and description.
   - Reference any related issues (e.g., "Closes #123").
   - Ensure all checks pass (CI/CD if set up).

### Review Process
- PRs will be reviewed by maintainers within 7 days.
- Address feedback and re-push changes.
- Once approved, your PR will be merged.

## Development Guidelines
- **Tech Stack**: Stick to the defined stack (React, Flask, MongoDB, Scikit-learn).
- **Dependencies**: Add new ones only if necessary; update `requirements.txt` or `package.json`.
- **Security**: Avoid hardcoding secrets; use environment variables.
- **Performance**: Optimize ML models and queries for efficiency.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure frontend is accessible (e.g., ARIA labels).

## First-Time Contributors
- Look for issues labeled "good first issue" or "help wanted".
- Set up the project locally as per README.md.
- Ask questions in issues or discussions if needed.

## Recognition
Contributors are acknowledged in the README or a CONTRIBUTORS file. Major contributions may earn co-maintainer status.
